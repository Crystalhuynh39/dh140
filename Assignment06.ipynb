Portions were good sized during our visit and price was right.  Staff were pleasant and attentive. The place definitely had the vibe of a bustling Japanese style diner, which we liked. We were there for lunch, and there was definitely a crowd. Now for the bad. I grew up with parents who lived in Japan. They always talk about how clean things are there. Like, impeccably clean. The place was not dirty, but it definitely could have used some cleaning, dusting, and sprucing up. When paying for my meal, I noted a cloth flag/divider behind the main cash register that was dirty to the naked eye that made me think - that could use a wash.

The beef was fine and loved the little noodles on the side where I have not seen anywhere else. I missed the taste of little zingy noodles. I think that was one of the reasons why I wanted to come back. The Seafood Mix made me sad. It was overcooked. One piece was so tough it had the consistency of an eraser.

    "For the first topic, we don't see many words that would be specifically associated with a comedy over a drama film besides maybe the word \"fun\". Many words like \"anna\", \"kendrick\", \"quit\", and \"year\" which are more specific to the plot of the movie itself rather than the genre since the film stars Anna Kendrick and is about a struggling college acapella group.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second topic, we also don't see many words that would be specifically associated with the comedy or drama genre. Again, we see words that are associated with the film itself like \"greta\", \"gerwig\", and \"alcott\" which represents Greta Gerwig as the film's director and Alcott as in the author of the original album.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both films that I chose are film adaptations of novels so we see words like \"stori\", \"adapt\", \"movi\", \"film\", and \"book\". However, these words are common in both topics due to the plot of the films themselves rather than being related to the genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "The words the model chose to represent the 2 topics don't particularly match with the split between comedies and dramas. This might be because many reviews discuss the plot of the movies, the actors and producers involved, and their general emotions. So words like \"like\", \"good\", and \"enjoy\" are vague and would not provide a distinction between the two genres as they can be used to describe either comedies or dramas. "
