# DH-140

This reporsitory is for Digital Humanities 140 in Winter 2022, coding for humanities course at UCLA which covers Python.

## Profile: 
Hi! I'm Crystal Huynh, a fourth year majoring in Economics and minoring in Digital Humanities. I'm hoping to improve my coding skills through this course.

A project that I would like to explore would be a sentiment analysis of online reviews or social media posts by creating a model that recognizes common speech patterns and see if that relates to typical human behavior or if it is something specfic to an online environment.
